[DeskPad][1] - A virtual monitor for screen sharing

![DeskPad Screenshot][2]

Certain workflows require sharing the entire screen (usually due to switching through multiple applications), but if the presenter has a much larger display than the audience it can be hard to see what is happening.

DeskPad creates a virtual display that is mirrored within its application window so that you can create a dedicated, easily shareable workspace.
