[QuestDB][1] is the fastest growing open-source time-series database offering **blazingly fast, high throughput ingestion** and **dynamic, low-latency SQL queries**. The entire high-performance codebase is built from the ground up in Java, C++ and Rust with no dependencies and zero garbage collection.

We achieve high performance via a column-oriented storage model, parallelized vector execution, SIMD instructions, and low-latency techniques. In addition, QuestDB is hardware efficient, with quick setup and operational efficiency.

QuestDB implements ANSI SQL with native time-series SQL extensions. These SQL extensions make it simple to analyze, filter and downsample data, or to correlate data from multiple sources using relational and time-series joins.
