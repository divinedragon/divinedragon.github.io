[termite][1] - Generate terminal UIs (TUIs) with simple text prompts.

![Termite Demo][2]

Termite lets you quickly prototype a terminal app to solve a problem. It works well for tasks like:

* "Show me which ports are active"
* "Make me a throughput monitor for my Redis queue"
* "Help me manage my Docker containers"
* "Diff these two SQL tables"

Under the hood, an LLM is generating and auto-executing a Python script that implements the UI. By default, UIs are built with the [urwid][3] library, but you can also use [rich][4], [curses][5], or [textual][6].
