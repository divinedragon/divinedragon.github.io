[sketch-rnn][1] - We made an interactive web experiment that lets you draw together with a recurrent neural network model.

![Sketch RNN Demo][2]

We taught this neural net to draw by training it on millions of doodles collected from the [Quick, Draw! game][3]. Once you start drawing an object, sketch-rnn will come up with many possible ways to continue drawing this object based on where you left off. Try the [first demo][4].
