[OpenRouter.AI][1] - A unified interface for LLMs. OpenRouter helps developers source and optimize AI usage. We believe the future is multi-model and multi-provider.

### Why OpenRouter?
* **Price and Performance** - OpenRouter scouts for the best prices, the lowest latencies, and the highest throughput across dozens of providers, and lets you choose how to [prioritize them][3].
* **Standardized API** - No need to change code when switching between models or providers. You can even let your users [choose and pay for their own][4].
* **Real-World Insights** - Be the first to take advantage of new models. See real-world data of [how often models are used][5] for different purposes.
* **Consolidated Billing** - Simple and transparent billing, regardless of how many providers you use.
* **Higher Availability** - Fallback providers, and automatic, smart routing means your requests still work even when providers go down.
* **Higher Rate Limits** - OpenRouter works directly with providers to provide better rate limits and more throughput.
