[Squoosh][1] is an image compression web app that reduces image sizes through numerous formats.

![Squoosh Screenshot][2]

Squoosh does not send your image to a server. All image compression processes locally.

However, Squoosh utilizes Google Analytics to collect the following:

* Basic visitor data.
* The before and after image size value.
* If Squoosh PWA, the type of Squoosh installation.
* If Squoosh PWA, the installation time and date.
