[MusicLab][1] is a website that makes learning music more accessible through fun, hands-on experiments.

All our experiments are all built with freely accessible web technology such as [Web Audio API][3], [WebMIDI][4], [Tone.js][5], and more. These tools make it easier for coders to build new interactive music experiences. You can get the open-source code to lots of these experiments [here on Github][6].
