Long after the Earth is gone, photons from your message will be racing across the cosmos in silent testament to your thoughts. Whether it's a poem, a prayer, a message in support of a cause, or a note to any intelligent life forms that may be listening, your text, image, or audio clip will be broadcast into space with our radio transmitter. Check back later to see how far it has traveled! SpaceSpeak provides a platform where people of cultures from around the world can see and share the best of humanity while learning about science, engineering, and math through our STEM projects.
