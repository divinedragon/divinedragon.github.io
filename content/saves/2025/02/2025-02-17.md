It creates small slices from your database and lets you navigate through your database following the relationships. Ideal for creating small samples of test data or for local problem analysis with relevant production data.

### Features

* The Data Browser lets you navigate through your database following the relationships (foreign key-based or user-defined) between tables.
* The Sub-setter creates small slices from your productive database and imports the data into your development and test environment (consistent and referentially intact).
* Improves database performance by removing and archiving obsolete data without violating integrity.
* Generates SQL (topologically sorted), JSON, YAML, XML (hierarchically structured) and [DbUnit][2] datasets.
* A demo database is included with which you can get a first impression without any configuration effort.
