[autossh][1] is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting it as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic.

The original idea and the mechanism were from [rstunnel][2] (Reliable SSH Tunnel). With version 1.2 the method changed: [autossh][1] now uses ssh to construct a loop of ssh forwardings (one from local to remote, one from remote to local), and then sends test data that it expects to get back.

## Features
* [autossh][1] is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting it as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic. The idea is from [rstunnel][2] (Reliable SSH Tunnel), but implemented in C.
* The author's view is that it is not as fiddly as [rstunnel][2] to get to work.
* Connection monitoring using a loop of port forwardings or a remote echo service.
* Backs off on rate of connection attempts when experiencing rapid failures such as connection refused.
* Compiled and tested on OpenBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, Cygwin, and AIX; should work on other BSDs.
* Freeware.
