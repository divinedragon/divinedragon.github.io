We introduce [Binoculars][1], a state-of-the-art method for detecting AI-generated text. Binoculars is a zero-shot and domain-agnostic (requires no training data) method. It is based on a simple idea: most decoder-only, causal language models have a huge overlap in pre-training datasets, for e.g. Common Crawl, Pile, etc. More details about the method and results can be found in our paper Spotting LLMs with Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text.
