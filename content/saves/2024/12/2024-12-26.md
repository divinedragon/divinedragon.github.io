[eza][1] - A modern, maintained replacement for ls, written in rust

![eza Showcase][2]

eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.
