[Superstreamer][1] - An open, scalable, online streaming setup. All-in-one toolkit from ingest to adaptive video playback. Built for developers in need of video tooling.

![SuperStreamer Screenshot][2]

Transcode and package your media for online streaming with simple API calls and sane defaults, or craft dynamic HLS playlists on the fly with bumpers, ads and filters.
* Transcode your video file into separate quality tracks (eg; 1080p, 720p, 480p).
* Write HLS CMAF playlists directly to S3, ready for playback!
* Want to insert a bumper like Netflix? Stitch it as an HLS interstitial on the fly.
* Insert linear ads as interstitials by providing a simple VMAP.
* Use our facade to interact with HLS.js, a heavily simplified wrapper that makes sense for player builders.
* Awesome React components to start building your own player.
