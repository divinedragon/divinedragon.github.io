[s3-enum][1] is a fast and stealthy Amazon S3 bucket enumeration tool. It leverages DNS instead of HTTP, which means it does not hit AWS infrastructure directly.

It was originally built back in 2016 to [target GitHub][2]

![S3 Enum Cover (AI Generated)][3]

## Usage
You need to specify the base name of the target (e.g., hackerone), and a word list. You could either use the example [`wordlist.txt`][4] file from this repository, or get a word list [elsewhere][5]. Optionally, you could specify the number of threads (defaults to 5).
