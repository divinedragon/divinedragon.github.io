[VersaTiles][1] is a completely FLOSS stack for generating, distributing, and using map tiles based on OpenStreetMap data, free of any commercial interests.

VersaTiles tackles this problem by defining a four-step process chain that defines how to process OpenStreetMap data and serve it as an interactive web map. It also provides a reference implementation of these four steps, but is flexible enough so that any step can be replaced by your preferred solution. For example, if you want to use a different tile source, server or frontend, you can simply replace the relevant part and still use the other steps.

The grey boxes represent data. The red boxes are steps that process the data. The whole process chain takes OSM data as input and produces a web map as output.
