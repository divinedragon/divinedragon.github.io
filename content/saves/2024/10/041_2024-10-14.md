[Typst][1] is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as [LaTeX][2] while being much easier to learn and use. [Typst][1] has:

* Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
* Flexible functions for everything else
* A tightly integrated scripting system
* Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
* Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
* Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong
