> Why did I create this? Over time, as I've worked on global AWS deployments, I have often been faced with the question of which inter-region transactions will be faced with the most latency. I have been able to find a lot of static examples of previous testing completed, or anecdotal thoughts based on a region's location. I haven't been able to find any kind of dynamic, consistently updated, latency monitoring. The goal here is to provide a single source of truth for inter-region AWS region latency.
