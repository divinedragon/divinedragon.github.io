Possibly the best Emoji Cheat-Sheet if you constantly scan the list of emoji's to find the one to use.

Thank you [ikatyang][1] for [this cheat-sheet][2].

I would still continue to use [copychar.cc][3] from time to time, for other characters, but emoji, I might just switch entirely to [ikatyang's cheat-sheet][2].
