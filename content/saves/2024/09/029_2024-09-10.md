[gpt-me][1] - Interact with an LLM assistant directly in your terminal in a Chat-style interface. With tools so the assistant can run shell commands, execute code, read/write files, and more, enabling them to assist in all kinds of development and terminal-based work.

A local alternative to ChatGPT's "Code Interpreter" that is not constrained by lack of software, internet access, timeouts, or privacy concerns (if local models are used).
