When you write [SOQL queries][1] in [Salesforce][2], you need to specify all fields of the Objects (Internal, External, Custom Settings, etc.). In a world where [Object-Relation Mapping (ORM)][3] have [existed more than 20 years][4], you can understand the [pain of developers][5] when they have to manually specify the fields of the objects. Every-time, you add a new field, manually adjust the [SOQLs][1] where you need the new field.

It felt a bit of a surprise, when [Salesforce rolled-out the feature][6] to provide fields using [`FIELDS`][7] keyword. Essentially, you could convert queries like this:

```sql
SELECT Id, CaseNumber, Type, Origin, Status FROM Case WHERE Id = :caseId
```

to

```sql
SELECT FIELDS(STANDARD) FROM Case WHERE Id = :caseId
```

You can specify:
1. `FIELDS(STANDARD)` - To fetch all Standard Fields of the Object
2. `FIELDS(CUSTOM)` - To fetch all Custom Fields of the Object
3. `FIELDS(ALL)` - To fetch both Standard and Custom Fields of the Object

> Isn't this such a wonderful feature for developers? Making their life easy and seeing less pain for developers?

Well, not so fast. Here are the pitfalls:

* `FIELDS(ALL)` and `FIELDS(CUSTOM)` is not supported in both [Apex][7] and [Bulk API][9]
  * Are you serious Salesforce? Really?
  * Anybody who has done half decent work in [Salesforce][2], knows [Custom Fields][12] are inevitable. [SOQLs][1] are primarily written in [Apex][7] where developers are painstakingly specifying each individual fields of the Objects (especially Custom Fields). And this is the place you don't want developers to use this. The sole purpose of this feature is to avoid explicit specification of fields, and yet, you decided to keep [Apex][7] out of this scope. Absolutely brilliant. ðŸ™„
  * Also, definitely stop people using this for [Bulk API][9], because, hey, we don't want to make life easy for people doing exports and taking data out of Salesforce for analysis outside. That should encourage people use Salesforce more. ðŸ™„
* `FIELDS(ALL)` and `FIELDS(CUSTOM)` is supported in both [REST API][10] and [SOAP API][11] with `LIMIT` clause
  * Wow, such generosity.
  * So, you want to make life easier for developers outside of [Salesforce][2] and integrating via the APIs. I wonder, Why? ðŸ¤”
  * Oh I know. So, that developers outside of [Salesforce][2] might feel that Salesforce is doing their best to improve developer experience overall, and that they don't end up writing posts like this one.
  * Essentially, Developers who are external to Salesforce and integrate with Salesforce via APIs, somehow are more important than Developers who work within Salesforce with Apex Classes, Triggers. Looks like your heart is in the right place. ðŸ™„
* You only have `FIELDS(STANDARD)` which is supported in [Apex][7], [CLI][8], and APIs([Bulk API][9], [REST API][10] and [SOAP API][11])
  * Of course this is what is fully supported since Salesforce would like you to stick to their standard implementation. It is well tested and less operational pain for Salesforce during support. ðŸ˜’

I genuinely wonder, about the considerations for providing this feature with such restrictions, and why can't this feature be rolled-out everywhere.

It's been more then 4 years (at the time of writing this post) since the [Spring 2021 Release][6], and no further adjustments have been made to this feature, till date. And while hoping is usually a good thing and you never say never, the chances for any adjustments for supporting it across all places, seems quite unlikely.
