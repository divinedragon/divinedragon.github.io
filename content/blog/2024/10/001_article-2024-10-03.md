I have been collecting a lot of notes over the years for various technologies, in different formats. Sometimes, they are bookmarks, sometimes just a simple note file, and sometimes in my old diary. But, lately it has been very difficult to access these notes effectively. Also, a lot of these notes might be useful for others as well.

So, I decided to put all these [notes here][1]. I will keep updating these notes over the period and also add more of my notes.

![Hugo Notes][2]

I use [Hugo][3] to build this blog and time to time I keep going back to these notes. Here is the link to the [dedicated notes for Hugo][4]. I will keep adding the notes as I go, but here are a couple of notes that are always handy for anyone who is starting with [Hugo][3].

## Starting the Hugo Server locally
The very first things that you would with hugo is starting the local server. Simplistic way is.

```bash
hugo server
```

But a better way is to start the blog with `--baseURL` argument, that generates the content very close to the Production build.

```bash
hugo server --baseURL="http://localhost:1313"
```

## Skip rendering certain elements on local Hugo Server

With time, you will start to have more things integrated in the blog. I use [SimpleAnalytics][5] and [Gisqus][6] for blog analytics and commenting support respectively. While it might be ok include scripts for such integrations while setting them up, after you have done that, you might not want to include them locally, just to avoid additional calls and getting distracted, while you write.

A simple way to exclude such things to be excluded from rendering process on Local Server is by the use of conditionals with `hugo.IsServer`. Something like this.

```hugo
{{ if not hugo.IsServer }}
    <!-- This is rendered only on Production Build  -->
{{ end }}
```
