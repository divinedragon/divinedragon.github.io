I have different types of pages within this website - [blogs][1], [saves][2], [reads][3] and [notes][4] (at least for now, unless I find more sections). I was earlier using `tag` based approach, where I was tagging all my posts under blog as tag `blog`, posts under reads as `reads`, and so on.

## Why the tags?

Why I am doing this is because `hugo` automatically builds the listing page for all posts which are marked with the tags. That way, when we click on a specific tag, we can get a list of all posts which are marked with that specific tag.

Here is the excerpt from my `public/tags` directory as rendered by hugo:

```bash
-> tree public/tags/
public/tags/
...
├── blogs
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.xml
│   └── page
│       ├── 1
│       │   └── index.html
│       └── 2
│           └── index.html
...
├── notes
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.xml
│   └── page
│       ├── 1
│       │   └── index.html
│       └── 2
│           └── index.html
...
├── reads
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.xml
│   └── page
│       ├── 1
│       │   └── index.html
│       └── 2
│           └── index.html
...
```

## Why this is a Problem?

While this works, it poses 2 challenges as described below.

### Problem 1 - Extra tag for each post

While the current theme allows for a pretty big list of tags, over the period, I have kind of grown very uncomfortable with this extra tag for each post type. I already have dedicated menu for each of those posts (blogs, saves, reads, notes), so a list page for those tags is just unnecessary. See below:

<img src="/blog/2024/10/images/003_tags-blogs.png" alt="Hugo Notes post highlighting the blogs tag" width="80%" class="image-center"/>


### Problem 2 - Not easy to detect different posts on the tag list page

For other tags (except `blogs, saves, reads, notes`), the only way to know what kind of post it is, we need to look at the tags. For example:

<img src="/blog/2024/10/images/003_tags-developer.png" alt="Tag List page highlighting the blogs and reads tag" width="80%" class="image-center"/>

While it is not that difficult, it does bring hindrance since scanning the tags takes a little bit of time, and it does starts to annoy after a while.

## What's the Solution?

One way, I could solve the visibility problem (Problem 2), is by having specific colors for each type of tag. While this is effective, I am personally, not a fan of too many colors. But since, I want to get rid of the tag altogether, this approach is anyhow out of question.

I felt a more visual way to indicate the kind of post in the **Title**. Something like this:

<img src="/blog/2024/10/images/003_tags-title-with-page-kind.png" alt="Tag List page highlighting the post kind in Title" width="80%" class="image-center"/>

## Considerations

[`hugo`][5] generates the page lists using the [`list.html`][6] located at `layouts/_default` (unless you or your theme changes this structure). So, all posts (`blogs, reads, saves, notes`) use the same [`list.html`][6] to generate the list of posts under that section or tag.

So, while it is good that we have a single place from where we can control the generation of the list pages, we need a way to identify what kind of listing page are we generating. So that, when we are looking at the list page for sections (e.g. blogs), we skip adding the title prefix, and when we are looking at the list page for tags, we add the title prefix.

## How to achieve it

Finally reaching the meat of the post.

We need to identify the [Page Kind][7]. Page Kind tells us if the page getting rendered is a simple page, a section or a term. These page kinds are documents and [explained here][7].

For tags, Page Kind value is `term`.

### Identifying the Page Kind for Tag List page

So, within our [`list.html`][5], we create a variable which tells us that if list rendering is done as part of tags.

```hbs
{{ $listPageTag := (eq .Kind "term") }}
```

Below is the excerpt from my `list.html` with the above change included.

```hbs
<div class="posts">
  {{ $listPageTag := (eq .Kind "term") }} <!-- Setting the variable -->
  {{ range (.Paginate (.Pages)).Pages }}
  <article class="post">
      {{ partial "post/info.html" . }}

      <!-- More code here -->
  </article>
  {{- end }}
</div>
```

### Duplicate post/info.html

From the above excerpt from `list.html`, post information is centralized in partial - `info.html` at location `layouts/partials/post/info.html`. While ideally, we could pass our `listPageTag` variable to the partial, I felt I might adjust my tags list page a bit more in future. Hence, I decided to duplicate my partial `info.html` to `info-with-kind-prefix.html`

```bash
-rw-rw-r-- 1 deepak deepak 1208 Oct 24 04:55 layouts/partials/post/info.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1 deepak deepak 1227 Oct 24 14:27 layouts/partials/post/info-with-kind-prefix.html
```

### Add conditional to render `info-with-kind-prefix.html`

Now, we have a variable which indicates when the tag list page is rendered, and we have a partial which we can use to adjust the post title. All we need is to add the [`if`][8] conditional like below:

```hbs
<div class="posts">
  {{ $listPageTag := (eq .Kind "term") }}
  {{ range (.Paginate (.Pages)).Pages }}
  <article class="post">
      {{ if $listPageTag }}                                 <!-- Conditional rendering for tag list page -->
        {{ partial "post/info-with-kind-prefix.html" . }}
      {{ else }}
        {{ partial "post/info.html" . }}
      {{ end }}

      <!-- More code here -->
  </article>
  {{- end }}
</div>

```


### Add the Title prefix

Within `info-with-kind-prefix.html`, we just need to add the prefix to the `Title`, whether the post is a `blog, saves, or reads`. Within a Page, we can use [`Page.Type`][9] to tell us which section the post belongs to. So, the place where we are rendering the `.Title`, we adjust the code as `{{ .Type}} - {{ .Title }}`. `.Type` usually returns the section name in lowercase, so can convert it to Title case using the [`title`][10] function.

```hbs
<h1 class="post-title">
  <a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ title .Type}} - {{ .Title }}</a>
</h1>
```

### Finally

And there we have it, all working beautifully
