I am trying to make sense of the down pour of money by various companies to solve human problems, when I see so many real problems like Climate Change, should be so much front and center everywhere.

It is refreshing to see researchers using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to be able to bring more visibility to the nature around us, and one of those research talking about [Elephants using name-like calls][1], and use of Machine Learning to help with their study. I hope more efforts are put to projects like [Earth Species][2] as opposed to finding new ways to make more money for corporate riches.

Quoting from the [article][1]:

> The model successfully [identified the recipient for 27.5%][3] of these calls â€“ significantly better than what it would have achieved by randomly guessing. This result indicated that some rumbles contained information that allowed the model to identify the intended recipient of the call.
