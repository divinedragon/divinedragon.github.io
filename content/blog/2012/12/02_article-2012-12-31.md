Every time when I have some task which is quite laboriousness and requires a lot of manual intervention, I think of some sort of automation. I think that because what I have understood during all my digital experience, that I am not the first one to be hit by these kind of boulders all along. At the same time, I am also not the only one who thinks that way when they are challenged with things like these. And finally, a lot of those people are way more smarter than I am for solving these problems. And what‚Äôs even more better is, they share their learning and experiences. I just love the open source family ‚ù§Ô∏è

Right, back to this post. Recently, my sister got married and as expected, a lot of pics were captured. I had specifically bought [Nikon L810][1] for it, and god, what images does it capture. But, you can‚Äôt upload those high-resolution images for sharing with your friends. That‚Äôs about 10G of images and in countries like mine, that size is a pretty high volume.

So, what what the task at hand? You guessed it right, trim down the image sizes to be smaller. From 5MB image sizes, I need to clip it down to KBs. I have been using [Adobe Photoshop][2] for this, but lately my Windows doesn‚Äôt work quite much. Crashes all the time. So, I was left with [Gimp][3].

So, I started with it. I got this [DBP plugin for GIMP][4] which would have solved my problem right away. But the source files didn‚Äôt work out. I didn‚Äôt have much time for getting into the debugging make install problems. I kept on searching. Somewhere on one of the Linux forums, I got this url for [ImageMagick][5].

I got to know that, there is a command in linux - [`convert`][6], which directly does that without any utility. I wrote a sample shell script for it and Voila, just a piece of cake or walk in the park. üòé

Here is the script.

```bash
for file in *.jpg; do
    convert -resize 800x800 "$file" "../small/sm_$file"
done
```

Doesn't get any simpler than this. üòéüòéüòé
