If you have had experience of web development and have hands on [`JavaScript`][1] coding, you will know how difficult it becomes at times when you have to debug [`JavaScript`][1] code. And it gets worse when you have multiple browsers rendering the [`JavaScript`][1] in their own ways. I could remember debugging the [`JavaScript`][1] code manually by putting those crappy and irritating `alert()` messages in the code to know how the code is being executed to root cause the issue. And if you know what I am talking about, you will know what I am talking about.

But browsers have evolved a lot is the last five years and so as the tools for web development. When I first started using the [Web Developer addon][2], it was like I had waited for it since ages for it. And I still feel there is no match for it. Even though the [`JavaScript`][1] console was available in Firefox, with usage of [Web Developer Addon][2], it was more accessible than ever.

Okay. Too much theory. Lets get to point. You need to debug [`JavaScript`][1] pages and get rid of those `alert()` statements. Here is what you need. Today, browsers come along with a [`JavaScript`][1] console. And you can log messages to them by using the [`console`][3] object.

Here is what you will need to write to log messages to [`console`][3].

```html
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
    for ( var i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {
        console.log("Log message - " + i);
    }
</script>
```

**However, you will need to use some addons for those.** If you are a [Firefox][4] lover (my buddy), you might know about [Firebug][5]. Install it. It's a web developer's true true mate. Here is a screenshot.

For that pathetic [Internet Explorer][7] (sorry if you love it), you need to have IE 7+ version and need to install [IE Developer Toolbar][8] to access that.
