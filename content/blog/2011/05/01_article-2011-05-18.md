This is pretty interesting and useful.

Sometimes, we might need to aggregate multiple row values into one single column. [Oracle 9i][1] provides [`xmlagg()`][2] function to achieve this.

Here is the employee table example which aggregates the multiple employee names into one column based on the department no.

```sql
SELECT
   deptno,
   rtrim(xmlagg(xmlelement(e, ename ',')).extract ('//text()'), ',') enames
FROM
   emp
GROUP BY
   deptno
;
```

And the output

```
    DEPTNO ENAMES
---------- ----------------------------------------
        10 CLARK,MILLER,KING
        20 SMITH,FORD,ADAMS,SCOTT,JONES
        30 ALLEN,JAMES,TURNER,BLAKE,MARTIN,WARD
```

Magic isnâ€™t it.
