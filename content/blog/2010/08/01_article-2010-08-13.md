I still remember the night when me and the [knight][1] were working on our [Java][2] project - [hamraDownloader][3]. What night that was - One system, two heads, [JavaDoc][4] and I guess 3-4 java ebooks, project aim, and most of them all, time constraint of submitting it on the next day. It was all setup for the perfect night out. And it really went crazier when we were roaming with a glass of tea up and down in the whole building. Truly miss those times.

Anyways, that day one thing we realized that for newbies of our level, you will surely get all the [Java][2] classes you need for your purpose. But those will be the abstract ones. That is, you don't know how to create the instance for them. And that is where I felt that [JavaDoc][4] provided no help. Its a very huge documentation, but very less examples. And if you don't have an Internet, your night is going to be the one like ours - memorable.

Anyways, so just as [Getting Real][5] points out,

> scratching your own itch is an important thing.

It is a pain area for new people like us and the people at the [Carnegie Mellon University][6] felt the same way.

Presenting [Jadeite][7] - Jadeite provides a human based approach to search for the classes in the [Java][2] API.

So, now you can make your [Java][2] project in less time and probably you will have to find another way to make your night memorable ðŸ˜‰

Happy Coding ðŸ˜‰
