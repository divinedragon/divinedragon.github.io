Working in [`JavaScript`][1] on the my project, I found an interesting thing which I would like to share with you all.

[`parseInt()`][2] method in [`JavaScript`][1] is used to parse a string text into integer. For example, to convert `String "8"` as `Integer 8` for processing, you will use it as follows:

```javascript
var parsedValue = parseInt("8");
```

You can find more details about the [`parseInt()`][2] method on [W3C Schools][3]

However, there is an interesting thing with [`parseInt()`][2]. When you try to `parseInt("08")` or `parseInt("09")`, the operation returns `0`.

This is because the leading zero tells the [`parseInt()`][2] method that it is an octal number and `08` is not a valid octal value. Hence the parsing returns `0` as output.

You might get this scenario when you trying to parse date values or month values containing leading zeros.

## Workaround

* Use the alternate form of `parseInt(value, radix)`. This form forces the parsing of the string value as per your radix value. `10` indicate for decimal, `2` indicate for binary, `8` indicate. So, `parseInt("08", 10)` will force it to interpret the string value `"08"` as a decimal value and not an octal. Thus, this will return `8` correctly after parsing.

* First convert the value to a `float` and then use `parseInt()`. For example:
  ```javascript
  var parsedValue = parseInt(parseFloat("08"))
  ```

  This will give you `8` as result.
