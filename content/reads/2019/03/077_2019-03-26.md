## Notes
* I wonder if today's generation can ever really understand how powerful this is
* A relationship only works if you behave mature. And being mature means, you understand what irritates you about the person you love, and know what buttons to trigger to irritate the person you love the most, and yet you chose to ignore that because this person loves you will all their heart.
* A relationship can always work, if the people involved are willing to make it work. It cannot be any simpler than that.
