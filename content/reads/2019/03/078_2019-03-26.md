## Notes
* A more practical based explanation for [Big O notation][2]
* Querying a value using the Redis cache key is `O(1)`
* Querying for a value in a List or a Set is `O(n)`
* Rule of Thumb
  * if there's a loop, it's `O(n)`
  * if I have to use a loop within a loop, that's `O(n^2)`
* Database indexes lookups are usually `O(log n)`
  * Iteratively split the dataset into smaller chunks and search the item until it is found
