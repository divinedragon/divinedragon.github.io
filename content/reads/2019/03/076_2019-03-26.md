## Notes
* Amazing talk by the author of [simdjson][2], the (probably) fastest JSON parser.
* TL;DR:
  * Avoid branches (means you need to up your game for Bitwise operators)
  * Use wide registers (512bits) on modern CPUs
* [Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)][3] based instructions in [Java][4] are available by [Vector API][5] (still in incubator stage)
