* [The Boolean Trap][1]
  * TL;DR - Use [ENUMs][2] instead

* [What are the most common bugs in LLM-generated code?][3]
  * The most common bug patterns included
    * **Misinterpretations (20.77%)**: where the LLM-generated code deviates from the intended functionality described in the prompt
    * **Missing Corner Cases (15.27%)**: where the LLM produces code that works for typical inputs but fails to account for less common or edge cases.
    * **Hallucinated Objects (9.57%)**: where LLMs generate code that references objects or functions that do not exist, leading to execution errors.
  * Recommendations for teams/leaders
    * Implement Rigorous Testing Frameworks - To catch bugs
    * Enhance Code Review Processes - Consider LLM code to be written by Junior Developer
    * Set Rules - Guidance on which topics to avoid using LLMs to generate code
    * Provide Training - Better prompts and workflows to reduce errors in generated code

* [Detecting AI-written code: lessons on the importance of data quality][4]
  * Despite our promising earlier findings, our final results have lead us to the conclusion that Binoculars isnâ€™t a viable method for this task. Reliably detecting AI-written code has proven to be an intrinsically hard problem, and one which remains an open, but exciting research area.
