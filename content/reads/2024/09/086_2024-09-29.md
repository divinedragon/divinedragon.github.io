## Notes
* Ideal Approach
  * Add a new column
  * Setup a trigger to update the new column
  * Batch migrate the values from old to new column over time
  * Create constraints and indexes that reflect the new column
  * Drop the legacy column
  * Rename the new column
  * Restart of all the application relying on the changed table
  * VACUUM FULL if your table is small and you have a planned outage. Otherwise, consider [`pg_repack`][2] or [`pg_squeeze`][3]. Check this article - [The Bloat Busters: pg_repack vs pg_squeeze][4]
