## Notes
* I liked the `Responsibility` aspect. This allows to get a broader understanding, ownership, and support for individuals. Otherwise, people just review technical aspects. Responsibility aspect will allow Engineers who remain in cocoon to come out. It also will promote collaboration with-in and cross-functional teams.
