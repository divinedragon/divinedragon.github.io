## Notes
* CSS properties (experimental) - [text-box-trim, text-box-edge, text-box][2]
* CSS has come a long way in-terms of how much you can control the style
* While we usually just rely on design libraries, it is so important for developers of design system libraries to know about such properties to allow seamless usage.
* Reminds me of 100-page PDF back around in 2010s just on the property - [`text-align`][3]
