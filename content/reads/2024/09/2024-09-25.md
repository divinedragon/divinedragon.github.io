## Notes
* One simple rule for debugging - **Reproduce the issue.**
  * Reproducing the issue should be the team's number 1 priority. The issue must be reproduced exactly, not just symptoms of the same behavior.
* Logging
  * If we can observe the patterns in the logs while reproducing the issue, then we can observe the patterns for the original instances of the issue.
* Finally a word of caution to those junior engineers among us:
  * There is no such thing as a favor in business.
* Absolutely loved the whole debugging narration. Couldn't relate and agree more. ðŸ˜‡
