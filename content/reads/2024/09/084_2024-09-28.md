## Notes
* Tips
  * Think about your files - What related files are you working with?
  * Identify metadata (for example, date, sample, experiment) - What information is needed to easily locate a specific file?
  * Abbreviate or encode metadata - Don't forget to document any codes!
  * Use versioning - Are you maintaining different versions of the same file?
  * Think about how you will search for your files - What comes first?
  * Deliberately separate metadata elements - Avoid spaces or special characters in your file names
  * Write down your naming conventions - Include a top-level README file on how to navigate the structure
* Relevant XKCD
