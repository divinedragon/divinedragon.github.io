* [Bad CSS-Dad Jokes - Part III][1]
  * My Favorite one [is this][2]

* [How not to change PostgreSQL column type][3]
  * Ideal Approach
    * Add a new column
    * Setup a trigger to update the new column
    * Batch migrate the values from old to new column over time
    * Create constraints and indexes that reflect the new column
    * Drop the legacy column
    * Rename the new column
    * Restart of all the application relying on the changed table
    * VACUUM FULL if your table is small and you have a planned outage. Otherwise, consider [`pg_repack`][4] or [`pg_squeeze`][5]. Check this article - [The Bloat Busters: pg_repack vs pg_squeeze][6]

* [ Re-architecting: Redis to SQLite][7]
  * Just proves why we popular applications/tools aren't always the right solution. We should always strive for simplicity, and consider trade-offs
