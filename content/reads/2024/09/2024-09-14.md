* [Why Scrum is Stressing You Out][1]
  * TL;DR - With sprints, there are no breaks, little autonomy, and insufficient time to prepare. No wonder developers today seem more stressed! The process is ill-suited to the nature of their work, and they are powerless to change it. The only remedy is to restore autonomy and professionalism to software development. Let developers control both their craft and their process. Treat them as respected peers, not replaceable cogs in a machine. However, achieving these conditions will likely require grassroots efforts by engineers, either through building more ethical organizations or transitioning to freelance work. Keep an eye out for articles from Rethinking Software to help you navigate these paths.

* [How we updated our Performance Review process to help engineers grow][3]
  * I liked the `Responsibility` aspect. This allows to get a broader understanding, ownership, and support for individuals. Otherwise, people just review technical aspects. Responsibility aspect will allow Engineers who remain in cocoon to come out. It also will promote collaboration with-in and cross-functional teams.

  * I read this and I just wonder, how much is enough in today's world of viral frenzy, eye-ball capturing society
