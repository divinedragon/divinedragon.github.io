## Notes
* Do not use pretty-printed JSON. Why?
  * You save bandwidth during transfer since the unformatted JSON is smaller is size
  * Less overhead during serializing/de-serializing
* If you still need the pretty printed JSON because you are debugging
  * Use utilities like [`jq`][2] or Javascript console
  * Request a pretty-printed JSON as part request param (`?pretty=true`)
* I think most libraries are already configured by default, unless the pretty-printing is explicitly enabled by developer. It might be hard to find such a developer who is doing this, but life always has it's way of surprising ðŸ˜„
