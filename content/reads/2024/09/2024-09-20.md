## Notes
* Wonderful article for anyone who cares about how code should be written
* Coding is Art and any developer who appreciates this art, will definitely resolve will all the points
* Here are a few of my favorite excepts

> If you want your product to be used, remove all the friction. Make it possible for users to use your product on their laptop in a couple of minutes, tops.

> Think about every error as an opportunity to nudge a user towards the happy path (what caused the error and how can they fix it)

> Every new conceptual thing you have to understand before using the tool makes is a new friction point. If it's 2-3 things, that's fine. But no one is going to bother learning 8 new concepts.

> Conceptual duck principle - If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck. Latch onto a users pre-existing mental model

> It's tempting to think that job as a tool provider is to minimize the amount of code a user has to write. But coding isn't golf! Perl tried very hard to optimize for shortest code. Python never tried to be shortest! It turned out Python code was super readable and thus much more understandable. And people read code 10x more times than they write it.
