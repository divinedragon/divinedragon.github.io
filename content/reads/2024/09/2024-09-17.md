## Notes

![Salesforce - Types of People using AI][2]

* Personas
  * 🥰 The Maximalist (30%): Maximalists are using AI multiple times a week to improve their work and are shouting from the rooftops about it.
  * 🤫 The Underground (20%): Undergrounds are Maximalists in disguise, using AI often but hesitant to share with their colleagues that they are doing so.
  * 😎 The Rebel (19%): Rebels don’t subscribe to the AI hype. They avoid using AI and consider it unfair when coworkers engage with these tools.
  * 🤩 The Superfan (16%): Superfans are excited and admire the advances made in AI, but aren’t yet making the most use out of it at work.
  * 🧐 The Observer (16%): Observers have yet to integrate AI into their work. They are watching with interest and caution.
* I am "The Underground". I use AI for very selective use cases where I know AI would help me be productive.
