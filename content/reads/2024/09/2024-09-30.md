* [Have we reached Peak Human?][1]
  * I am passionate about pursuing [Collective Super-intelligence][2] because it has the potential to greatly amplify humanity’s cognitive abilities, and unlike a digital super-intelligence it is inherently instilled with human values, morals, sensibilities, and interests. Of course, this begs the question — _how long can we stay ahead of the purely digital AI systems?_ That depends on whether AI continues to advance at an accelerating pace or if we hit a plateau. Either way, amplifying our collective intelligence might help us maintain our edge long enough to figure out how to protect ourselves from being outmatched.
  * Detailed talk on [Collective Swarm Intelligence (CSI)][3]

* [Why PostgreSQL 17's Incremental Backup Feature is a Game-Changer][4]
  * Here’s how it works:
    * **Full Backup vs. Incremental Backup:** A full backup copies everything in the database, while an incremental backup only captures the changes made since the last backup.
    * **Recovery Process:** By taking regular full backups and adding incremental backups in between, you can speed up the recovery process significantly. Instead of replaying all the data changes (WAL) from the last full backup, you only need to apply the smaller, incremental changes.
  * In [early testing][5], supported by EDB, we’ve seen a significant improvement in recovery times for PostgreSQL, dropping from 78 minutes to just 4 minutes in one test, a reduction in recovery time by almost 95%.
  * My side note - I hope, now we are able test our database backup playbooks.

* [Why is everyone LYING about LLMs?][6]
  * Exactly, my points all the way. People are just blatantly lying, because the other person in front either doesn't know the things, or is so much into the AI hype-train that they don't care checking the facts.
