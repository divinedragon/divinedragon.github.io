## Notes
* With sprints, there are no breaks, little autonomy, and insufficient time to prepare. No wonder developers today seem more stressed!
* The process is ill-suited to the nature of their work, and they are powerless to change it.
* The only remedy is to restore autonomy and professionalism to software development. Let developers control both their craft and their process.
* Treat them as respected peers, not replaceable cogs in a machine.
* However, achieving these conditions will likely require grassroots efforts by engineers, either through building more ethical organizations or transitioning to freelance work.
* Scrum-fall - Combination of Scrum and Waterfall (Worse of both worlds)
