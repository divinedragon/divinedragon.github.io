## Notes
* The most common bug patterns included
  * **Misinterpretations (20.77%)**: where the LLM-generated code deviates from the intended functionality described in the prompt
  * **Missing Corner Cases (15.27%)**: where the LLM produces code that works for typical inputs but fails to account for less common or edge cases.
  * **Hallucinated Objects (9.57%)**: where LLMs generate code that references objects or functions that do not exist, leading to execution errors.
* Recommendations for teams/leaders
  * Implement Rigorous Testing Frameworks - To catch bugs
  * Enhance Code Review Processes - Consider LLM code to be written by Junior Developer
  * Set Rules - Guidance on which topics to avoid using LLMs to generate code
  * Provide Training - Better prompts and workflows to reduce errors in generated code
