## Notes

[Vinted][2] transitioned from Elasticsearch to [Vespa][3] to improve its recommendation system's scalability, efficiency, and flexibility. Key points from their journey include:

* **Limitations of Elasticsearch**: While Elasticsearch was powerful, it struggled with specific demands such as low-latency vector searches with metadata-based filtering, essential for personalized recommendations.
* **Evaluation of Vespa**: Vespa offered first-class support for machine learning-based search and ranking, real-time data updates, and flexibility for metadata filtering. It also aligned with Vinted's preference for open-source software.
* **Performance Benchmarks**: Vespa demonstrated superior performance, achieving 3.8x faster document indexing and 8x higher query throughput with significantly lower latency.
* **Adoption Results**: Vespa simplified configuration, provided detailed monitoring, and improved scalability while ensuring user satisfaction during A/B testing.
