## Notes

### Quotes

> If companies would have as little respect for business as they have for presentations, the majority would go bankrupt - [John Medina][2], Author of [Brain Rules][3]

> "If it isn't written, write it yourself."' - [Franz Kafka][4]

### Have one idea per slide
* If you've got more than one message, the chance is big they will be focusing on this one and not that one, or that one and not this one. Just make it simple for human beings. Have one message per slide

### Slides with Text and Speaking at the same time is bad.
* If you have text, sentences on your PowerPoint, and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time, what will be remembered by the audience is zero or very close to zero

### Size
* The most important part of your PowerPoint should also be the biggest, nothing else
* How often is the headline the most important part in a PowerPoint? It's very rare.
* People will be spending 70% of the time on the headline when it's not the most important part

### Contrast
* Use contrast to keep the attention of the audience on a specific topic and not get distracted

### Use Black Backgrounds
* If I use the Black Background, your eyes relax. You focus on me. I'm the biggest object. I'm the most contrast-rich object. I got your focus. Why is that important?
* It's important because I am, I always have been, and I always will be the presentation. That is my visual aid.

### Use no more than six objects per slide
* Less object on the slide makes the audience feel comfortable and not lose focus
* Six or less objects take about 0.2 seconds for brain to recognize
* Sever or more takes about 1.2 seconds
* 10 or more takes about 2 seconds

### More Slides are ok
* With less objects on each slide, your slides will become longer, yes.
* But that is not a problem because you will go through those slides quicker because you are talking about only 1 concept, and have more attention from your audience.
