## Notes
* Underlines the importance of why understanding the data access mechanisms/patterns is important. It is sad, that sometimes this gets overlooked.
* Especially in teams where frontend and backend teams are different and they are working in silos or not looking the functionality from end-to-end perspective.
* A better understanding of the underlying dependencies or upstream dependencies can really help design systems better.
