* [The hardest bug investigation of my career and the insane code that caused it][1]
 * I guess every-time we see a bug with periodic nature to it, we should automatically start looking for issues with Date-Time parsing/formatting/conversion.
 * And every-time, I see issues related to date-time and timezones, I can never help but to go and watch this [Youtube Video][2] from Tom Scott go absolute nuts over time and timezone problems. It starts slow, and then quickly escalates into madness.

* [The Proliferation and Problem of the ✨ Sparkles ✨ Icon][2]
  * Yes, sparkles everywhere ✨✨✨
  * TL;DR

    > The challenge with this icon is **sparkle ambiguity**: Participants in our recent research study generally agreed that it represented something a little special. But, what was that something? And why was it special? That was less obvious. We encountered widely and wildly varied interpretations.

* [Know your menu: Hamburger vs. Kebab][5]
  * TL;DR
    > When in doubt, always assume that the 3 dots, or kebab icon means menu. If you see the 3 lines or hamburger icon, it typically means a navigation drawer.
  * TIL - There are a whole bunch more - Hot Dog, Fries, Cake. Below are all of them
