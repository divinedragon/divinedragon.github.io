## Notes
* Every-time we should see a bug with periodic nature to it, we should automatically start looking for issues with Date-Time parsing/formatting/conversion.
* And every-time, I see issues related to date-time and timezones, I can never help but to go and watch this [Youtube Video][2] from [Tom Scott][3] go absolute nuts over time and timezone problems. It starts slow, and then quickly escalates into madness.
