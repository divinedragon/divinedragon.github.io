## Notes
* To scale your test suite, go beyond the test pyramid.

  ![SMURF mnemonic spider-web][2]

### The SMURF mnemonic
* An easy way to remember the tradeoffs to consider when balancing your test suite:
  * **Speed**: Unit tests are faster than other test types and can be run more often—you’ll catch problems sooner.
  * **Maintainability**: The aggregated cost of debugging and maintaining tests (of all types) adds up quickly.
  * **Utilization**: Tests that use fewer resources (memory, disk, CPU) cost less to run.
  * **Reliability**: Reliable tests only fail when an actual problem has been discovered.
  * **Fidelity**: High-fidelity tests come closer to approximating real operating conditions (e.g., real databases or traffic loads) and better predict the behavior of our production systems.

* The relationships between the SMURF dimensions are in tension
  * Improving one dimension can affect the others
  * If you can improve one or more dimensions of a test without harming the others, then you should do so
