## Notes

* If only, people at the top of the money hierarchies, can be generous enough to make things better. We can only hope.

> Generosity isn’t just a sign of virtue. It’s also a mark of intelligence.

> Data: people with high IQs have more unselfish values, give more to charity, and negotiate better deals for others. They prioritize the long-term collective good over short-term self-interest.

> It’s smarter to be a giver than a taker.

> when “success” is a sprint, givers will often finish last. But when success is a marathon, givers often finish first.
