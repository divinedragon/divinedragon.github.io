## Notes
* I was discussing along the same lines with one of my colleague who is equally burdened with meetings
* We were discussing that we should give a talk with title - `Meetings we are invited to`
  * Meetings where we are really not required, but still get invited because the organizer needs support
  * Meetings where you are covering for someone, and have a very specific discussion points. You hardly worry about what else gets discussed
  * Meetings which sometimes you attend out of habit (Stand-ups in particular)
  * Meetings which you ideally want to avoid, but cannot for undisclosed reasons
  * Meetings to guide folks on things which are obvious
* I believe there are more unnecessary meetings
