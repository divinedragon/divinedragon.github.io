## Notes
* I really look forward to this research. With Diabetes becoming a norm in pretty much anyone in their 40s and even 30s now, I really hope we are able to have medicine for treatment. The numbers of Type-2 Diabetes patients is growing ever so rapidly.
* Here are a few info-graphics via [International Diabetes Federation][2] as of 2021.
