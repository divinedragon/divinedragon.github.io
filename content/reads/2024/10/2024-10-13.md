* [The Rise and Fall of Object Relational Mapping][1]
  * My Opinion
    * Use ORMs for the simplest of things and 1-1 mappings.
    * The moment you start to deal with 1-n, n-1, n-n mappings, you need to re-think what you are trying to achieve with ORM mappings.
    * Sometimes, just writing the SQL is a lot more easier and intuitive as compared to letting ORM do the magic for you which gets very tricky to debug.
* [The Art of Attention][2]
  * *Simplification is not just a matter of de-cluttering our physical surroundings â€” it is a way of thinking, of living. As we quiet the noise within, we see more clearly what truly matters. We focus, not on everything, but on the essentials. We pare down, not by force, but by choice.*
* [Apple's study proves that LLM-based AI models are flawed because they cannot reason][3]
  * I just hope this gets shared as well by the AI Evangelists, as much as they bask the news of [AI winning Nobel Prize][4]
  * AI alone is not going to do wonders. It is the data and the careful applications that bears the fruit of efforts. AI (and especially Generative AI) is not a silver bullet for everything.
