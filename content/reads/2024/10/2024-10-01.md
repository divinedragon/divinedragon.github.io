## Notes
* One interesting aspect that is highlighted and I also feel is - using `latest` tags is good for images that are non-critical, and you always want the latest version.
* An example can be, if you have a mock-server or end-to-end test image. Again, this is only applicable if your mock-server or end-to-end test images are not absolutely critical.
* Also, any other situations as long as it reduces your or team's overhead, without risking the application deployment (like local environments or test environments or loosely coupled dependencies).
