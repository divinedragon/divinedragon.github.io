* [What's Wrong With The Docker :latest Tag?][1]
  * One interesting aspect that is highlighted and I also feel is that using `latest` tags is good for images that are non-critical, and you always want the latest version.
  * An example can be, if you have a mock-server or end-to-end image. Again, this is only applicable if your mock-server or end-to-end test images are not absolutely critical.
  * Also, any other situations as long as it reduce your/team's overhead, without risking the application deployment (like local environments or test environments or loosely coupled dependencies).
* [90% of performance is data access patterns][2]
  * Underlines the importance of why understanding the data access mechanisms/patterns is important. It is sad, that sometimes this gets overlooked.
  * Especially in teams where frontend and backend teams are different and they are working in silos or not looking the functionality from end-to-end perspective.
* [How even quick Node.js async functions can block the Event-Loop][3]
  * Good to recap the internal working of the [Node.js][4] [event-lop][5]
