* [The Disappearance of an Internet Domain][1]
  * Never quite thought about 2 character Internet Domain (.io, .me, .co, etc.), and I guess it might be worth to just avoid 2 or 3 character [Top Level Domains][2].
  * I personally don't think the existing `.io` domains will be cancelled right away.
  * Also, since `github.io` is quite a popular domain (probably the most popular one), Microsoft would have to worry, rather than me worrying about it.
* [Google's AI thinks I left a Gatorade bottle on the moon][3]
  * I recently put [ai.robots.txt][4] on my blog so that AI Crawlers don't consider my articles for their data generation. Well, that does not stop them to crawling it anyway.
  * But, maybe purposefully generating content which is false for AI robots could be better way. [Garbage In, Garbage Out][5] ðŸ˜ˆ
  * But, it is also disrespect to all developers who are working so hard to make this technology better. So, I hope AI crawlers respect content privacy.
