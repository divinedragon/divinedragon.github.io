## Notes

### My Opinion

* Use ORMs for the simplest of things and 1-1 mappings.
* The moment you start to deal with 1-n, n-1, n-n mappings, you need to re-think what you are trying to achieve with ORM mappings.
* Sometimes, just writing the SQL is a lot more easier and intuitive as compared to letting ORM do the magic for you which gets very tricky to debug.
