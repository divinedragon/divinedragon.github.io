## Notes

* I [posted my thoughts][2] about this as well
* It's amazing to know that a Magnitude 25 level earthquake might cause the Sun to explode. My guess without this knowledge would have been probably 100 or more.
* Its also funny that this scale goes in negative direction. Me pressing keys on my mechanical keyboard is probably a Magnitude -2 on [Moment Magnitude Scale][3], which usually is Magnitude -5 on regular keyboards. I can really relate to pain of my coworkers üòÅ
