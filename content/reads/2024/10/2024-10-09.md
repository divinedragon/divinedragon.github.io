* [crokinole - Board game][1]
  * Very interesting board game. So many unique games which are so amazing to know.
  * The article is a very nice primer to the game

* [You should be using an RSS reader][2]
  * I tried to use use so many news/feed aggregators. And never I could get the reading workflow to my liking
  * That is when, I started to create my own feeds.
  * It is dead simple, no clutter, no ads, and the best part - you are in control.

* [A History of Microwave Ovens][3]
  * Nice to to back in time and look at the evolution of microwave ovens.
