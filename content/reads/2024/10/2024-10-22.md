## Notes
* Never quite thought about 2 character Internet Domain (`.io, .me, .co` etc.), and I guess it might be worth to just avoid 2 or 3 character [Top Level Domains][2].
* I personally don't think the existing `.io` domains will be cancelled right away.
* Also, since `github.io` is quite a popular domain (probably the most popular one), Microsoft would have to worry, rather than me worrying about it.
