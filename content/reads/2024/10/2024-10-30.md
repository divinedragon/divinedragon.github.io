## Notes
* Whenever I have used [LaTeX][2] earlier, I always felt glad that I don't have it use it often
* With [Typst][3], I can totally see myself using it more often
  * I am tempted to use if for [my Resume][4] now üòÅ. I need to hold my excitement for now.
* Also, a very detailed comparison with LaTeX which clearly shows why [Typst][3] is better for beginners like me venturing into LaTeX world.
* [Saved Typst][5]
