## Notes
* Yeah, doesn't surprise me at all to see this. Database tables are already structured, validated and refined. So, of course, you need a LLM to give you more context about this data.
* This example is just funny. Why can't you just do this from any other LLM integration
  ```sql
  SELECT prompt('Write a poem about ducks', ‘gpt-4o’) AS response;
  ```
* Also, your junior developer does this and your OpenAI bill goes over the roof
  ```sql
  -- Table with 1 Million rows
  SELECT prompt('summarize the comment in a Haiku: ' || text) AS summary
  FROM sample_data.hn.hacker_news -- Skips LIMIT clause
  ```
