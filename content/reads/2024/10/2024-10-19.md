## Source - [stackoverflow.com][1]

## Notes
* Same week, another annoyance removed. The latest update ([v.1.92][2]) with Context Menu with Scrolling - I am not a fan. I prefer all options to be present.
* Until there is a config to adjust this behavior, you can reset the window style - `"window.titleBarStyle": "custom"`
* You will need to restart
