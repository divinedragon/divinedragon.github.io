## Notes
* TL;DR

  > I’d say folks are better off being more like [Hank Green][2] (intellectually curious, willing to seek out information and be proven wrong) and less like [Elon Musk][3] (intellectually uncurious, willing to believe utter nonsense so long as it reinforces your priors).

* Here is the video from Hank, in which he investigates why his ballot paper had democrats listed at the bottom of the ballot.
* He got angry initially because he thought it was a way for people in power were trying to manipulate the system, but then when we dig a little more, we understood that the list is randomized.
* To the quote below

  > Everything is a conspiracy theory when you don’t understand how anything works.

  Hank gives a more accurate version below

  > Everything is a conspiracy theory **when you don’t trust anything.**

  Because, You have to not trust anything and also not have the intellectual curiosity to find out what’s true
* Even though he was initially concerned, before he spouted off, he did the research and found out that his concerns were unfounded.
