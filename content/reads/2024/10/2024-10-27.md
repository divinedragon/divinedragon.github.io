## Notes
* I just hope this gets shared as well by the AI Evangelists, as much as they bask the news of [AI winning Nobel Prize][2]
* AI alone is not going to do wonders. It is the data and the careful applications that bears the fruit of efforts. AI (and especially Generative AI) is not a silver bullet for everything.
