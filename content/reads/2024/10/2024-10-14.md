## Notes

* I tried to use use so many news/feed aggregators. And never I could get the reading workflow to my liking.
* That is when, I started to create my own feeds via [RSS][2] back in 2019.
* It is dead simple, no clutter, no ads, and the best part - you are in control.
* I use [Feedly][3] for my feeds, just so that I can read in both my laptop and mobile, and have them in sync.
* I don't follow any feeds that are available to chose from. Instead, I specifically curated my feeds from the sources, which I feel provide value with their posts.
