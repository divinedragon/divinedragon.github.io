* [VS Code - Allow to change the font size and font of the workbench][1]
  * It's been almost a decade since this feature is requested and changing fonts for the entire workbench is still not supported üòí
  * It's also amazing to see so many like-minded developers
* [What would a magnitude 15 earthquake be like?][2]
  * I [posted my thoughts][3] about this as well
  * It's amazing to know that a Magnitude 25 level earthquake might cause the Sun to explode. My guess without this knowledge would have been probably 100 or more.
  * Its also funny that this scale goes in negative direction. Me pressing keys on my mechanical keyboard is probably a Magnitude -2 on [Moment Magnitude Scale][4], which usually is Magnitude -5 on regular keyboards. I can really relate to pain of my coworkers üòÅ
* [Exploring Typst, a new typesetting system similar to LaTeX][5]
  * Whenever I have used [LaTeX][6] earlier, I always felt glad that I don't have it use it often
  * With [Typst][7], I can totally see myself using it more often
    * I am tempted to use if for [my Resume][8] now üòÅ. I need to hold my excitement for now.
  * Also, a very detailed comparison with LaTeX which clearly shows why [Typst][7] is better for beginners like me venturing into LaTeX world.
  * [Saved Typst][9]
