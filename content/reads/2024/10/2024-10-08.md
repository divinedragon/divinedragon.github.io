* [Not remotely cool: The science of "Zoom fatigue"][1]
  * I was discussing along the same lines with one of my colleague who is equally burdened with meetings
  * We were discussing that we should give a talk with title - `Meetings we are invited to`
    * Meetings where we are really not required, but still get invited because the organizer needs support
    * Meetings where you are covering for someone, and have a very specific discussion points. You hardly worry about what else gets discussed
    * Meetings which sometimes you attend out of habit (Stand-ups in particular)
    * Meetings which you ideally want to avoid, but cannot for undisclosed reasons
    * Meetings to guide folks on things which are obvious
  * I believe there are more

  > In technical communication, we donâ€™t talk much about decision support; we talk about task support... In many cases, the information people need to complete their tasks is not information on how to operate machines, but information to support their decision making... simply documenting the procedures is never enough... What I am talking about is documenting the context, letting users know what decisions they must make, making them aware of the consequences, and, as far as possible, leading them to resources and references that will assist them in deciding what to do.
  * At my level, I realize after reading this, that I get approached so often for task support.
