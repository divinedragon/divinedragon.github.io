## Notes

> Slash pages are common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like `/now`, `/about`, or `/uses`. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.

* And to be consistent with this movement, I believe I will change my `/save` to `/bookmarks` soon
