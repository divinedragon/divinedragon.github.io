## Notes
* Five Cannons of [Rhetoric][2]

### 1. Idea
* The heart of a great presentation lies in the message itself, not in how it looks.
* To captivate your audience, you need a compelling story. Stories create connections.

  > They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel. ―Carl W. Buechner

* Investing time in improving your storytelling skills will be invaluable in many aspects of your life.
* When preparing a presentation, most of your time should be spent on the story. The design should evolve out of your structure.

### 2. Order
* A clear flow keeps your audience engaged. Your structure is the framework.
* It gives your message order and makes it easy to follow. Without structure, even a great story can lose impact.

#### 2.1 Don’t Worry About the Start, Just Start
* When starting to prepare a presentation, don’t worry too much about your first words. Just start.
* Once you’ve written your story and you know what you will say, the intro will come easily.

  > The best openings come at the end.

#### 2.2 One, Two, Three...
1. **Introduction (Set the Stage)** - Start by introducing your key message. Explain the problem or challenge. Show why the audience should care. Keep it short and clear. Give a quick overview of what’s to come.
2. **Development (Build the Case)** - This is the main part. Present your argument or story. Each point should connect to the next. Make sure your ideas flow logically.
3. **Conclusion (Wrap Up)** - End by summarizing your key points. Reinforce the core message. Leave the audience with something to remember. Finish strong to make a lasting impression.

#### 2.3 One Idea per Slide
* Stick to one idea per slide
* Too many ideas on one slide can confuse the audience.

#### 2.4 Logical Flow
* Make sure the presentation flows in an order that makes sense.

#### 2.5 Repetition for Impact
* Repeat key points to make them stick
* You can do this through words, visuals, or slides.
* Don't overdo it

#### 2.6 Timing and Pacing
* Watch your timing. Don’t rush through your points.
* Make sure your content fits within the time you have
* Give your audience time to absorb the message.

#### 2.7 Structure and Restructure
* Write the speech first, then optimize, but keep optimizing your structure until it makes sense.
* A strong structure helps guide your audience. It makes your message clear and keeps them focused.

### 3. Style

#### 3.1 Find the Right words
* Instead of trying to find the right picture, find the right words. Think about the right metaphor before you think about the right picture.
* Think about your audience. Speak their language. You are not speaking for yourself, you are speaking to those who listen.

#### 3.2. Design
* Keep it simple. Avoid using too many graphics, fonts, colors, and effects.
* Adding more ingredients does not mean your dish will taste better

  > Often, great taste comes from simple and less ingredients

#### 3.3 Typography
* The fewer words you have on the slide, the less you need to worry about typography
* Avoid Walls of Text
  * Putting a lot of text on a slide and reading it out to the audience is the #1 presentation killer.

    > If you can’t write your message in a sentence, you can’t say it in an hour.

  * Ensuring that your slides are easy to read. Think about people with poor eye-sight at the back of the room
* Careful with Bullet Points
  * [Death by PowerPoint][3] - Excessive use of bullets in presentations. Bullet points is where PowerPoint gets its name from.
  * Your audience is too busy digesting the information on the slide to listen to you. While they are scanning your list to try to understand it, you are talking in the void.

#### 3.4 Images
* Choose pictures carefully. Images can be technically splendid, with great colors, lighting, and a wonderful landscape. But if they don’t tell a good story they make a lot of noise without adding meaning.

#### 3.5 Charts and Tables
* Clear charts, concise visuals, straightforward slides, and plain language.
* To judge a picture, chart, or any graphic, always ask yourself: Does it tell a clear story or is it just a bunch of boring numbers to pretend that I am serious?

### 4. Rehearse and Memorize
* Ideally, you’ll rehearse an important presentation three times from beginning to end.
* Ideally, you know your slides so well that won’t need the teleprompter anymore.

  > Keeping it simple is easier said than done. Simplicity, is, as Leonardo said, the ultimate sophistication.

### 5. And.. Action
* Finish on time and avoid a stressful, incomplete conclusion.
* Convey only the most important points for them to remember and bring back home.
* Being afraid to speak in front of a crowd is normal
