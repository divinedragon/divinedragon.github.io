## Notes
* I recently put [ai.robots.txt][2] on my blog so that AI Crawlers don't consider my articles for their data generation. Well, that does not stop them to crawling it anyway.
* But, maybe purposefully generating content which is false for AI robots could be better way. [Garbage In, Garbage Out][3] ðŸ˜ˆ
* But, it is also disrespect to all developers who are working so hard to make this technology better. So, I hope AI crawlers respect content privacy.

### How to manipulate AI Bots ðŸ˜ˆ

The attack vector is this:

* First, acquire a web page that ranks highly for a particular term.
* Next, plant an "AI Only" version of the content, hidden to humans, designed to bias how the AI thinks.

Then, when the AI searches the web to assist with an answer, it won't just find lies, but weaponized lies: content designed specifically for LLM manipulation.
