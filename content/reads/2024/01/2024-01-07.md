* [5 Annoying Things In VS Code You Can Fix Right Now][1]
  * The most important one is the first one. [Search Panel][2] crammed in the side bar was the biggest annoyance for me as well. I also use [Eclipse][3], and I am used to search results at the bottom. In [Eclipse][3], you could just move the panels around in whichever way you like, but I never thought you could do the same. Felt such a novice all this while. Here is how you can do it too (sourcing the gif directly from Caleb's post)

* [pwgen - man page][5]
  * I have been online websites like [passwords-generator.org][6] to generate my passwords. But then, then I thought why do I need a website to generate this for me. I could just use my terminal for it. Quick peek into the Software, and found [`pwgen`][5]. And it has everything and more that I need. Created an alias with `pwgen --secure --capitalize --num-passwords 3`.

* [Are your engineering “best practices” just developer dogmas?][7]
  * Everyone needs to talk to [Igor from time to time][8]
