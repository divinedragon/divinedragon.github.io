## Notes
* Misconception: [Sloths][2] are lazy
  * [Sloths][2] are notoriously slow but don't mistake their sluggishness for laziness. Their speed is due to a low metabolic rate, which means they need to conserve energy for survival - not for kicks.
  * I love sloths ðŸ¦¥
* Misconception: [Elephants][3] are scared of mice
  * It's true that, just like humans, they don't particularly love it when little things come scurrying out and take them by surprise.
  * Elephants seem to react genuinely negatively to the insects, perhaps because they don't want to get them up their trunks.
* Misconception: [Cows][4] have four stomachs
  * While the digestion process is very different from how the human stomach works, it does take place in a single stomach, with some cud chewing along the way.
* Misconception: [Pigeons][5] are stupid
  * [Pigeons][5] can remember over a hundred images and remember them two years later, can think abstractly, distinguish paintings, and, according to [one report][6], have better self-cognition than some 3-year-old humans.
  * [Columbidae][5] - Bird family name of doves and pigeons
* Misconception: [Cats][7] don't really care about their people
  * Cats actually do get attached to their owners and even view their humans as part of their family.
  * If your cat headbutts you or starts kneading their paws on you before curling up in your lap, rest assured it means you're loved.
