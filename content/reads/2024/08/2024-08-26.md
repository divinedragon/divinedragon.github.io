## Notes
* Overheads
  * Awkward versioning (Fragment A needs old version X, while Fragment B needs uses newer version Y)
  * Any refactoring which involves dependent teams makes it more complex than it would have been a monolith
  * Lack of visibility to End-to-End understanding - Not a very scalable developer experience
