## Notes
* It's a good guiding article. I get involved in too many things because I care, and then have too many things going in parallel
* TL;DR
  * Avoid the little bugs - I kind of disagree to this. If the bug is straight-forward and takes at most 1 hour to fix, then just fix it and be done with it. Otherwise, too many tiny bugs keep piling up and they could affect your features as well
  * Prioritize for impact
  * Triage
  * Focus
    * _It's okay to drop bugs as "not worth the effort" after you've invested a bunch of time. Better that than wasting even more time._
