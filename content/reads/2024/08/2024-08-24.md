* [Let small fires burn][1]
  * It's a good guiding article. I get involved in too many things because I care, and then have too many things going in parallel
  * TL;DR
    * Avoid the little bugs - I kind of disagree to this. If the bug is straight-forward and takes at most 1 hour to fix, then just fix it and be done with it. Otherwise, too many tiny bugs keep piling up and they could affect your features as well
    * Prioritize for impact
    * Triage
    * Focus
      * _It's okay to drop bugs as "not worth the effort" after you've invested a bunch of time. Better that than wasting even more time._
    * The Algorithm - [Make it Work, Make it Right, Make it Fast][2] - [Kent Beck][3]
    * Measure your impact
* [Entropy - Explained with Sheep][4]
  * Very informative and structured explanation of [Entropy][5]
  * [Veritasium][6] also a [very nice video about Entropy][7] with a lot more background context
* [Micro-frontends should be your last resort][8]
  * Overheads
    * Awkward versioning (Fragment A needs old version X, while Fragment B needs uses newer version Y)
    * Any refactoring which involves dependent teams makes it more complex than it would have been a monolith
    * Lack of visibility to End-to-End understanding - Not a very scalable developer experience
