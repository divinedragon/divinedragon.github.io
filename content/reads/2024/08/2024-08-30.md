* [Doing support makes you a better engineer][1]
  * Faster feedback loops - Engineers don't need to wait for Users and Product to tell how the feature is working
  * Engineers feel accountable - Constant small improvements which Engineers take decision and ownership
  * Fosters innovation - Often, engineers doing support find innovative solutions to solve user problems

* [AI development and agile don't mix well, study shows][2]
  * _"work items repeatedly had to either be reopened in the following sprint or made ridiculously small and meaningless to fit into a one-week or two-week sprint"_. In particular, AI projects "require an initial phase of data exploration and experimentation with an unpredictable duration."
  * _"instead of adopting established software engineering processes -- which often amount to nothing more than fancy to-do lists -- the technical team should communicate frequently with their business partners about the state of the project."_
  * The RAND team identified the leading causes of AI project failure:
    * "Industry stakeholders often misunderstand -- or mis-communicate -- what problem needs to be solved using AI. Too often, organizations deploy trained AI models only to discover that the models have optimized the wrong metrics or do not fit into the overall workflow and context."
    * "Many AI projects fail because the organization lacks the necessary data to adequately train an effective AI model."
    * "The organization focuses more on using the latest and greatest technology than on solving real problems for their intended users."
    * "Organizations might not have adequate infrastructure to manage their data and deploy completed AI models, which increases the likelihood of project failure."
    * "The technology is applied to problems that are too difficult for AI to solve. AI is not a magic wand that can make any challenging problem disappear; in some cases, even the most advanced AI models cannot automate away a difficult task."

* [The state of Java after Java 17][3]
  * While the vast majority of applications operated on Java 8 (84.48%) as of March 2020, nearly half (48%) of applications now use Java 11 in production, compared to 46.5% of applications in Java 8.
  * While [Oracle][4] still leads the market at 34.5%, Amazon has grown to support 22% of the market with [Amazon Corretto][5]. Additionally, four other vendors command a market share of at least 5%: [Eclipse Adoptium (11.5%)][6], [Azul Systems (8.2%)][7], [Red Hat (6%)][8], and [IcedTea (5.4%)][9]
