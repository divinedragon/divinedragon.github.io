## Source - [linux.die.net - pwgen man page][1]

## Notes
* I have been using online websites like [passwords-generator.org][2] to generate my passwords. But then, then I thought why do I need a website to generate this for me. I could just use my terminal for it.
* Quick peek into the Software, and found [`pwgen`][1]. And it has everything and more that I need.
* Created an alias with `pwgen --secure --capitalize --num-passwords 3`

```bash
# alias gp="pwgen --secure --capitalize --num-passwords 3"
-> gp 15
