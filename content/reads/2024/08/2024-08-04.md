## Notes
* I keep on saying this, AI applications are going where it is not intended to. The latest [Google Sydney Ad][2] depicts exactly where AI should not be used, and how usage of AI in places where it should not be, will affect our current and future human generations.
* This sums it up pretty neatly - _If you do want to help your kid write a fan letter as an exercise, don't give her a tool designed to extrude the average of all the other letters that have come before it. Sit down with her and help her be specific. When did you first see Sydney compete? What does it look like to you when she goes over a hurdle? How do you feel when you see her perform? Do you like her stance? The way she hits a finish line? Her smile when she wins? What do you love about running? And sure, go over spelling with her if you want, too, or help her with her grammar. It's a perfect opportunity._
* Just like writing code is an art, so is writing. LLMs can help you write better if you only know how to write in the first place.
