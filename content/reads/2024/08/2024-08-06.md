## Notes
* [Usain Bolt][2], for one, estimated that he ate [100 McDonalds chicken nuggets][3] each day at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, because they were a familiar food he knew his stomach could handle. He went on to win three gold medals.
* Current popular Olympic participants
  * [Haley Batten][4] (Age - 25, Mountain Biking, US)
    * Haley Batten has a race-day favorite that she also eats before hard workouts: pancakes topped with bananas and maple syrup. They’re a good source of carbohydrates, she said. She usually eats roughly two to three hours before training or competing.

  * [Luke Willian][6] (Age - 28, Triathlon, Australia)
    * When Luke Willian woke up at 7:20 a.m. one day in July, he turned to his go-to breakfast: two cups of cornflakes with whole milk. He followed this meal with a hard open-water swim. After the swim, he ate two salami-and-cheese sandwiches and a cake bite at 10 a.m, for a mix of carbs and protein. Then he was off for an “easy” six-mile run, followed by a quick protein shake — and then a trip to a cafe for a latte and a piece of cheesecake. This was all before 11:30 in the morning.

  * [Asia Hogan-Rochester][8] (Age - 25, Rugby Sevens, Canada)
    * At the athletes’ village in Paris on Wednesday morning, they sampled the offerings with carbs and protein intake top of mind: granola with almond milk, watermelon, a croissant, yogurt and a few sides of chicken dim sum sausage, brie cheese and veggie pierogies.

  * [Kasra Mehdipournejad][10] (Age - 31, Taekwondo, Iran)
    * Kasra started a recent day around 7 a.m., with a breakfast of banana pancakes with raspberries and blueberries. Three hours later, he snacked on cherries, blueberries and peaches, along with a boiled egg. At 10:30 a.m., exactly an hour before a strength training session with free weights, he had a shot of espresso.

  * [Chuck Aoki][12] (Age - 33, Paralympic wheelchair rugby, US)
    * His first meal was fruit and yogurt, around 7 a.m. His second, more substantial breakfast was turkey sausage, hash browns and scrambled eggs with hot sauce.
