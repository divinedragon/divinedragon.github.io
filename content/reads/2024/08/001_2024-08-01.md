* [Ideal use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence][1]
  * I am trying to make sense of the down pour of money by various companies to solve human problems, when I see so many real problems like Climate Change, should be so much front and center everywhere.
  * It is refreshing to see researchers using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to be able to bring more visibility to the nature around us, and one of those research talking about [Elephants using name-like calls][1], and use of Machine Learning to help with their study. I hope more efforts are put to projects like [Earth Species][2] as opposed to finding new ways to make more money for corporate riches.

  * Option 1 - **The straw trick:** Place a straw in your mouth and pinch the other end closed. Blow for about 15-20 seconds.

  * Option 2 - **The diving reflex:** Fill a bag with ice, hold your breath and place the bag on your face for 20-30 seconds — or as long as you can comfortably hold your breath. Make sure the coldest areas hit your eyes, sinuses and nose. If you don’t have ice, use a bag of frozen vegetables, or fill a bowl with chilly water and immerse your face — it’s just a little more messy that way.

* [Germans Combat Climate Change From Their Balconies][6]
  * Plug-and-play solar panels are popping up in yards and on balcony railings across Germany, driven by bargain prices and looser regulations.
  * Start-up mentioned in the Article - [solago][7]
