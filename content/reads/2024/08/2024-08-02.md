* [The antithesis of the Olympics: Using AI to write a fan letter][1]
  * I keep on saying this, AI applications are going where it is not intended to. The latest [Google Sydney Ad][2] depicts exactly where AI should not be used, and how usage of AI in places where it should not be, will affect our current and future human generations.
  * This sums it up pretty neatly - _If you do want to help your kid write a fan letter as an exercise, don't give her a tool designed to extrude the average of all the other letters that have come before it. Sit down with her and help her be specific. When did you first see Sydney compete? What does it look like to you when she goes over a hurdle? How do you feel when you see her perform? Do you like her stance? The way she hits a finish line? Her smile when she wins? What do you love about running? And sure, go over spelling with her if you want, too, or help her with her grammar. It's a perfect opportunity._
  * Just like writing code is an art, so is writing. LLMs can help you write better if you only know how to write in the first place.

* [One Misconception About 64 Different Animals][3]
  * Misconception: [Sloths][4] are lazy
    * [Sloths][4] are notoriously slow but donâ€™t mistake their sluggishness for laziness. Their speed is due to a low metabolic rate, which means they need to conserve energy for survivalâ€”not for kicks.
    * I love sloths ðŸ¦¥
  * Misconception: [Elephants][5] are scared of mice
    * Itâ€™s true that, just like humans, they donâ€™t particularly love it when little things come scurrying out and take them by surprise.
    * Elephants seem to react genuinely negatively to the insects, perhaps because they donâ€™t want to get them up their trunks.
  * Misconception: [Cows][6] have four stomachs
    * While the digestion process is very different from how the human stomach works, it does take place in a single stomach, with some cud chewing along the way.
  * Misconception: [Pigeons][7] are stupid
    * [Pigeons][7] can remember over a hundred images and remember them two years later, can think abstractly, distinguish paintings, and, according to [one report][8], have better self-cognition than some 3-year-old humans.
    * [Columbidae][7] - Bird family name of doves and pigeons
  * Misconception: [Cats][9] donâ€™t really care about their people
    * Cats actually do get attached to their owners and even view their humans as part of their family.
    * If your cat headbutts you or starts kneading their paws on you before curling up in your lap, rest assured it means youâ€™re loved.
