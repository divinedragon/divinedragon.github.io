## Notes
* Option 1 - **The straw trick:** Place a straw in your mouth and pinch the other end closed. Blow for about 15-20 seconds. If you don’t have a straw, place your finger in your mouth and blow against it as if it were a straw. The technique is one example of a ["Valsalva maneuver"][5] — named after the Italian physician who discovered it.
* Option 2 - **The diving reflex:** Fill a bag with ice, hold your breath and place the bag on your face for 20-30 seconds — or as long as you can comfortably hold your breath. Make sure the coldest areas hit your eyes, sinuses and nose. If you don’t have ice, use a bag of frozen vegetables, or fill a bowl with chilly water and immerse your face — it’s just a little more messy that way.
