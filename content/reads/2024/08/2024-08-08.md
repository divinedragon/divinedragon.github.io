* The most important one is the first one. [Search Panel][2] crammed in the side bar was the biggest annoyance for me as well. I also use [Eclipse][3], and I am used to search results at the bottom. In [Eclipse][3], you could just move the panels around in whichever way you like, but I never thought you could do the same. Felt such a novice all this while. Here is how you can do it too (sourcing the gif directly from Caleb's post)
