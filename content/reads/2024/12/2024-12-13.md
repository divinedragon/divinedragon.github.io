## Notes
* My Favorite one are:
  * I searched for the perfect grayish-purplish color. It took a long time, but I found it in a `#DECADE`
    * [Posted it as well][2]
  * Why do `<script>` and `<link>` have trust issues? Because the other HTML elements don't have `integrity`.
  * What is a CSS Developer's favorite dessert? Chocolate `padding`
