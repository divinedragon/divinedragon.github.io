## Notes
* Ancestor - [Malus sieversii][2]
* Just like most things, [Silk Road][3] helped the spread
* [Quince][4] fruit was the reason for [Trojan War][5]. Never saw or heard that fruit until now.
* Before [HoneyCrisp][6] and after [HoneyCrisp][6]
  * HoneyCrisp's texture - the crispness - had never been combined with a high-acidity, high-sugar apple.
  * Before, there were basically two categories to describe texture - soft/mealy or hard/firm/dense
  * Once you've had crisp, it's hard to go back.
* [Grafting][7] - New seedlings or branches that produce the desired fruit are notched into a "rootstock" apple tree.
* Apple breeders continue to test new varieties for five to 15 years after the initial taste test to screen for disease resistance, heat resilience, winter hardiness, the ability to bear every year (some bear only every other year) and other traits.
