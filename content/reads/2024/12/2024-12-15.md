## Notes
* [SQLite][2] does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with [fopen()][2].
* A local sqlite database can solve scalability, and network bottlenecks on a single redis or database.
* Just proves why we popular applications/tools aren't always the right solution. We should always strive for simplicity, and consider trade-offs.
