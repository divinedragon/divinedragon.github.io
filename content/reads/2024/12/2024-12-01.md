## Notes
* Again, an article coming from a Co-Founder and CTO. I would really love to have developers writing such articles. A company who wants to sell a product in a world of AI marketplace, and advocating the usefulness of AI, is conflict of interest in the first place.
* Yes, the newer models are getting better, but developers need to still provide the prompts to generate that code
* What I fail to understand is why developers need to adjust their coding workflow, just so that they are able to use a tool.
* Writing prompts and reviewing the generated code takes time (as much as writing on my own)
* The places where AI generated tests will be useful is when the code itself is a generated AI code
* And I don't know how many times I can re-iterate, writing code is not just blurting out a sequence of code instructions. There are intricacies and art to it.
* With prompts, you can only generate a lot of scaffolding code or applications which are intended for non-production use, but not a full fledged production grade application.
