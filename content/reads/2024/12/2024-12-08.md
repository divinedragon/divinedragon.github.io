## Notes

### TL;DR

After reviewing many options, I recommend the following:
* If your project can afford the pricing of [Clerk][4], go with them.
* If not and you have backend / devops experience, choose [Ory][9]. I’ll write a guide for it in the next post.
* Otherwise, choose [Firebase][7]. Be aware though that the free version will probably be deprecated in the future.

### [Supabase][2]
> Red flag 1: No setting for session lifetime<br/>
> Red flag 2: Client-side unencrypted tokens<br/>
> Red flag 3: Inconsistent, undocumented behavior, no communication<br/>
> Red flag 4: Lack of care for Auth<br/>
> Red flag 100: No 2FA on their own platform<br/>

### [NextAuth.js / Auth.js][3]
> I’m looking for a battle-tested auth solution developed and maintained by people who have a strong background in security. NextAuth.js didn’t pass this test for me.

### [Clerk][4]
> In my opinion, Clerk’s Business plan is the nicest hosted auth solution if your business model fits their pricing. In my case it didn’t, so I continued my journey.

### [FusionAuth][5]
> All in all, FusionAuth is probably a workable solution, but it would require investing way more time compared to alternatives. In summary, I would be spending a lot of time on the wrong priorities just to be able to use a closed-source software. I prefer to look for alternatives.

### [ZITADEL][6]
> The architecture of ZITADEL is probably solid, and with enough time spent, I could probably figure out all the configuration issues. Their company was responsive, they always replied immediately on GitHub in a helpful and professional way.<br/><br/>
> If they could add a native Next.js library as well as a detailed tutorial about how to get from zero to the clean login UI like they are advertising, it could even be a winner!

### [Firebase][7]
> Even with all the limitations, Firebase is still one of the best choices today when it comes to Auth. The abandoned React library doesn’t give a good feeling but the linked GitHub snippets work and you can get the first integration done super quickly.<br/><br/>
> Later on, it might give you headaches if you want to sync user data to your own DB, but if you are happy to use their DB it can be a solid choice.

### [SuperTokens][8]
> I might be nitpicking here, as the setup is really simple and it works and the team was very quick to respond when I asked a question from them.<br/><br/>
> It just doesn’t give me a good feeling about how a codebase would look in the future if even the simplest possible example app looks like this. For example, in a classic, server-side rendered app (say Django or Rails), this would be 100% hidden from the developers (and also extremely well-tested by now). I understand that in a Next.js app, you have to see some of it, but this is just too much for my taste.<br/><br/>
> All in all, I decided not to use SuperTokens even though I got it up and running in no time.

### [Ory][9]
> I decided to stay with Ory because their team was very professional and I believe those issues will be addressed soon. In my opinion, the core service is very solid, just the integration parts are having some rough edges.

### [Auth0][10]
> It’s unreasonably expensive, yet is the standard solution for Enterprise companies.

### [KeyCloak][11]
> Open-source alternative, but even seasoned ops professionals are talking about configuring it like wartime stories.

### [WorkOS][12]
> if I understand correctly - is only providing Enterprise features, like SAML.
