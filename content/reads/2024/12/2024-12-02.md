## Notes
* [Text Fragments Specification][2]

### Basic Syntax

```bash
https://example.com/page.html#:~:text=[prefix-,]textStart[,textEnd][,-suffix]
```

Following the hash symbol, we add this special syntax `:~:` also known as fragment directive then `text=` followed by:

* `prefix`-: A text string preceded by a hyphen specifying what text should immediately precede the linked text. This helps the browser to link to the correct text in case of multiple matches. This part is not highlighted.
* `textStart`: The beginning of the text you're highlighting.
* `textEnd`: The ending of the text you're highlighting.
* `-suffix`: A hyphen followed by a text string that behaves similarly to the prefix but comes after the text. Also helpful when multiple matches exist and doesn't get highlighted with the linked text.

### Styling highlighted fragments

Use the `::target-text` pseudo-element

```css
::target-text {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```
