## Notes
* "I am passionate about pursuing [Collective Super-intelligence][2] because it has the potential to greatly amplify humanity’s cognitive abilities, and unlike a digital super-intelligence it is inherently instilled with human values, morals, sensibilities, and interests. Of course, this begs the question — _how long can we stay ahead of the purely digital AI systems?_ That depends on whether AI continues to advance at an accelerating pace or if we hit a plateau. Either way, amplifying our collective intelligence might help us maintain our edge long enough to figure out how to protect ourselves from being outmatched."
