## Notes
* Here’s how it works:
  * **Full Backup vs. Incremental Backup:** A full backup copies everything in the database, while an incremental backup only captures the changes made since the last backup.
  * **Recovery Process:** By taking regular full backups and adding incremental backups in between, you can speed up the recovery process significantly. Instead of replaying all the data changes (WAL) from the last full backup, you only need to apply the smaller, incremental changes.
* In [early testing][2], supported by EDB, we’ve seen a significant improvement in recovery times for PostgreSQL, dropping from 78 minutes to just 4 minutes in one test, a reduction in recovery time by almost 95%.
* My side note - I hope, now we are able test our database backup playbooks.
