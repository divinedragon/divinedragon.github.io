## Notes

Author's Haunted Domain - [musicbox.fun][9]

> In a perfect world, when your legitimately good content isn’t being surfaced by Google, it’s a failure on **their** part, and **their** problem to solve, not yours. In practice, it is your problem and you have to do a bunch of work to help them see that their current assessment of your domain name is no longer accurate.

### Haunted Domain
* Something terrible happened at the domain name in the past.
* On the surface, nothing seems wrong with the domain name.
* Then there are signs that something isn’t right.
* Obligatory jump-scare when you discover what happened.
* Internal debate: do you abandon it or try to fix it?
* There’s a ton of superstition around how to fix it.
* Superficial fixes don’t seem to work.

### How to check if a domain name is haunted

1. Check the Way-back Machine at [archive.org][2]
2. Search [DMCA complaints][10]
   * [Google's Transparency Report][3]
   * [Lumen Database][4]
3. Search historical SEO data

### My domain is haunted. What now?

1. Talk to the search engines
   * Take guidance from this [StackOverflow post][6]
   * Create profile in Webmaster tools like [Google Search Console][7] and [Big Webmaster Tools][8] and report when the issues have been resolved
2. Double-down on best practices
   * SEO basics, like high-quality, structured, accessible, content on a fast-loading site, are table stakes.
3. Wait for a while?
