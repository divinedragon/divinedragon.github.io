## Notes
* It was interesting to see the git workflow for somebody else
* I must say, isn't quite different from mine. Here are a few slight variations, though:
  * I don't have any aliases. I prefer explicit command, so that I know what I am typing
  * I don't use [squash-merge][2] strategy, so I pay a lot more attention to the commit messages
* Other notes
  * Interesting point about the demo video. Might be useful for reviewers to get an understanding of how the changes were tested
  * Can't emphasize enough of this point

    > Before I ask someone to review my PR, I read through the diff on the pull request page myself. Something about it being not in your editor makes you spot more bugs and left-over print statements.

  * It still befuddles me that so many people still create PRs and straight away send it for review
  * On this

    > When I review someone elses code, I always try to check out the code and run it and test that it actually does what the pull request message says. You'd be surprised by how often it doesn't.

    * As long as the team is aligned to do this, this should be really good way to keep the quality in check.
    * At the same time, it can be a little laborious
