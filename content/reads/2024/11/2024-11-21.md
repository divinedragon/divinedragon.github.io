## Notes

### Multi-Versioned Storage
* Usage of Old to New approach
  * While updating new rows, Postgres uses Old Row to New row (O2N) list as compared to New Row to Old (N2O).
  * Most databases (Oracle, MySQL, etc.) today use N2O
  * O2N - Avoids updating the indexes, but retrieving of the latest row has overhead (traversal to the new row via following the oldest point and all intermediate rows in between). Retrieval is done more often as compared to updating the indexes.

### Storing [tuple id][2] along with index for each version
* This provides direct access to the updated row, but adds overhead on index to maintain every new version.
* To avoid multiple index entries,
  * Postgres tries to create a new copy of the row in the same page (block)

### Version Vacuum
* Since, there are long chains of versions which are not "live", Postgres performs regular autovacuum to clean up the index entries and reclaim deleted rows.

### Why this approach is problematic (O2N)
* Version Copying
  * Massive data duplication (since it creates a new row if you update a single column or all columns) - Resulting in slower queries and higher cloud costs
* Table bloat
  * If you have high writes, then autovacuum could take time to catch-up. Since, the deleted rows still exists, they continue to take space and make your queries slow
  * The autovacuum only removes dead tuples and relocates live tuples within each page, but it does not reclaim empty pages from the disk.
  * To reclaim storage, you need [`VACUUM FULL`][3] which will re-write the table pages
    * This operation is very heavy and not recommended to be run on Production systems
    * Large tables can take a long time for a full vacuum.
* Secondary Index Maintenance
  * All indexes whose updated row gets allocated to a new page, will have additional entry pointing to this new row.
    * Eg. if you have a column which is part of 5 indexes, and this column is updated and the corresponding new row gets allocated on a new page, Postgres will add 5 new record entries in the index tables.
* Vacuum Management
  * Default [`autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`][4] set to 20%. Means, if you have 100 Million rows, autovacuum does not kick-in unless 20 Million rows are updated
  * autovacuum may get blocked by long-running transactions, which could result in even more dead tuples
  * Recommendation - After long-running transactions (eg. bulk updates), perform autovacuum right away
