## Notes
* And the fact that, people are bloodlessly following the AI train, accountability is just put aside.
* The consequences of the failed projects will mostly be blamed with more lay-offs, while all people who should be put to account, are easily getting away to find the next hype train.

  > No one at Fox seems to have explicitly made a decision to lie about voting machines; rather, there was an implicit understanding that they had to do whatever it took to keep their audience numbers up. At some point, someone had declared (or else strongly implied) that audience metrics were the only thing that mattered, and every subsequent decision followed out from that.

  * Summarizes the same thing for organizations. Leadership felt AI is the solution of all their problems, without even realizing if they need it in the first place or not.
  * No feedback from the people who will be building AI solutions, and have a better understanding of the problems and how this AI technology works.
