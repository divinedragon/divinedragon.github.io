## Notes
* While I totally understand the technological superiority in decisions like this, I also feel that this changes the way Sports are played.
* What becomes of Tennis, or any other sport for that matter when we remove all humans from it. Why not just have robots play tennis, otherwise.
* Any sporting body today makes more than sufficient money to still keep the human folks around, even if they are deemed redundant. It preserves the legacy, originality, and nostalgic feel of the sport.
