## Notes

### Examples
> "I'm not motivated to work harder or innovate when you and your bosses get most of the credit and all the bonus money."

> "Employee engagement is low because key leaders aren't trusted or respected and nothing serious gets done about that."

> "I can't make good decisions unless you and your bosses are more transparent with financial or strategic details."

> "I think we're growing and making enough money right now."

### Why?

> At most organizations — my own included — history and culture mean that certain statements draw negative knee-jerk reactions. And I fear that this is getting worse because we live in a world where language is weaponized to shut down serious discussion as soon as someone feels threatened. For example, in the U.S., all you have to do to shut down a serious discussion about some aspects of our capitalist system is to call the speaker a "socialist" or "communist." Conversation over. Deep rules kept intact.

### To Drive Change
* Discuss the undiscussables - There is no beating behind the bush
* Fix the follies - Ask people to tell you about the organization's [follies][2]
* Explore the ["veil fails."][3] - You can tell whether something is fair by considering it from behind a "_veil of ignorance_" wherein you don't consider your status among the people affected
