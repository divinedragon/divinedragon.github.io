## Notes

### Use atomic commits
* Each commits only describes one update (bug fix, feature, config change), and contain only the changes related to that update

### Identify your fixes and non-fixes
* Using any convention to your like, e.g. a prefix for the commit title such as `fix:` or `bug:`, or maybe a tag at the bottom of the commit message, like `#upstream-fix`

### No evil merges
* No [evil merges][2] - If you have merge commits, make sure those do not introduce any changes.

### [Rebase early, rebase often][3]
* The longer the period between rebases, the higher the chances of having a very different upstream code base since the last time you rebased. This of course increases the probability of having conflicts.

### Contribute changes back
* Contributing changes back to upstream (be it features, bug fixes, etc.) is not just a good way to give back to a project you are using, but it will also very much make your job easier, since from the moment upstream adopts those changes, they are no longer yours to maintain.

### Keep a good relationship with upstream
* Knowing the conventions and guidelines of a project, learning from discussions with maintainers, asking for their input when you have big changes to make (even if those are just meant to be downstream) goes a long way to build the trust that will end up in reviews moving faster, or in giving your input as well when upstream makes changes.
