## Notes

### Tog's Paradox
* Tog's Paradox (also known as [The Complexity Paradox][2] or Tog's Complexity Paradox) is an observation that products aiming to simplify a task for users tend to inspire new, more complex tasks.
> [when] we reduce the complexity people experience in a given task, people will take on a more challenging task.
> - [Bruce Tognazzini, The Complexity Paradox][2]

### What does it signify
* One of the key reasons for the symptom of requirements changing after delivery in enterprise software products, and for feature creep in consumer products.
  * Users demand new features
  * Users take additional responsibilities or shift focus areas as the time saved with delivered features, needs to be consumed somewhere
* Explains why it's futile to try to completely nail down requirements for a software product, as the product itself will have an impact on the users, causing them to demand new functions.
