## Notes
* It isn't quite a new concept. Support teams and Feature teams are along the same lines
* The one problem with Support teams is Companies don't quite spend enough on Support engineers. Also, engineers should rotate in support and feature teams. Engineers get a lot better understanding of the product is used, however, I see a lot of Engineers these days not quite open for such kind of support engagement.
* This depiction of impact on developer productivity due to an interruption is quite accurate
