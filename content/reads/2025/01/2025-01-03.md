## Notes
* Top 10 companies are
  * [H&R Block][2]
  * [Delta Airlines][3]
  * [L3Harris][4]
  * [Accenture][5]
  * [Nike][6]
  * [Tradesmen International][7]
  * [Disney Experiences][8]
  * [Addus HomeCare][9]
  * [IBM][10]
  * [Amazon Flex][11]
* I would have loved to see their evaluation criteria as well. The fact that Accenture is placed so high, and knowing the work culture back in India, I have my doubts on this list.
