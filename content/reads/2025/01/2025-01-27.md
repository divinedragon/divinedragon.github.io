## Notes
* The world's largest iceberg, `A23a`, is heading towards the British island of South Georgia.
* It is currently 173 miles away and could potentially ground and smash into pieces, putting penguins and seals in danger.
* A23a once measured 3,900 sq km but is now around 3,500 sq km and is slowly decaying.
* It calved from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 and has been on its final journey since December 2023.
* The warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its sides.
* A23a could break into vast segments any day, which may then hang around for years.
* South Georgia is home to precious colonies of King penguins and millions of elephant and fur seals.
