## Notes
* A handy list of all plain text email clients
* Etiquette recommendations for plain text emails
  * Top Posting
    * I must say I also find it so annoying when you receive a very long email thread with somebody just tagging you with `Hi, can you take a look at this?`
    * A good etiquette would be to reply to only the relevant sections.

  * Wrapping your text
    * Wrapping text in emails is encouraged for improved readability, especially in technical contexts.
    * Most recommended email clients automatically wrap text at 72 columns or use `format=flowed` to maintain the original formatting when quoting.
  * Why is plain text better than HTML?
    * HTML as a vector for phishing
    * Privacy invasion and tracking
    * Higher incidence of spam
    * Mail client vulnerabilities
    * HTML emails are less accessible
    * Some clients can't display HTML emails at all
    * Rich text isn't that great, anyway
  * Recommendations for software which sends emails
    * For senders of automated emails
      * Send a [multipart/alternative][2] email with both a plain text and HTML version included.
    * For senders of user-authored emails
      * Allow users to compose emails in plain text, and consider making this the default. When the user composes a message in plain text, send a text/plain email instead of a multipart/alternative email with a generated HTML part.
      * When composing a plain text email, hard-wrap their lines at 72 columns by inserting newlines at the nearest word boundary. Optionally, use format=flowed instead to allow plain text emails to be displayed and composed without hard wrapping.
      * When users reply to an email in plain text, don't encourage top-posting by leaving their cursor above the quoted message. Instead, add two newlines after the quoted message and leave their cursor there. Allow the user to edit the quoted message. Quote each line of the original message with > and a single space, followed by the quote.
      * When users send an HTML email explicitly, convert it to text/plain and send a multipart/alternative email which includes both versions.
      * When displaying multipart/alternative emails, give the user the option to prefer to view the plain text part by default.
